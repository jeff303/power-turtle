@Elango:

I'm Elango, and this is Tim.

Our talk is entitled "Learning Clojure through Logo".

This talk presents our personal views, not those of our employers.

# Learning via Logo

# Logo and Clojure

# Clojure and reach

???

# Overview

This talk will be about:
* why Logo is a compelling learning environment
* how Logo relates to Clojure
* how Clojure can expand its potential audience in surprising ways

* Logo is a programming language to control a turtle (an object).
* The turtle is represented as a triangle.
* You send movement commands to the turtle instructing it where to go.
* When the pen is down, wherever the turtle goes, it draws a line.

You can issue commands like

    (right 30)
    (forward 50)
    (left 60)
    (forward 50)
    (back 100)

       FORWARD 25
       REPEAT 8 [  RIGHT 45   FORWARD 50  ]
       HOME
     END

???

* Currently many efforts to teach kids programming
  - Blockly - a JS library for graphical code created at Google
  - Other things based on Blockly (code.org, physical games for kids with coding component)
* You can see the Logo origin
  - Moving character with spatial commands, structuring commands
  - As Lispers, Logo code blocks -> Lisp forms without parens
  - Paredit mode (struct. editing) = snapping blocks together inside others in blocks
* Irony:
  - we use Lisp today as an easy, effective way to teach kids programming
  - when the kids grow up, they program with semi-colons & curly braces
  - then we come back to Lisp - unrivalled power and simplicity
* Which begs the question:
  - if the same thing is good for beginners and very advanced users...
  - ...then why do we avoid it in between?

# How is Logo interesting?

???

* Logo - I loved learning it:
  - took a class in middle school, at age 11
* reveal
  - easy to pick up
* reveal
  - drew random pictures
* reveal
  - learned how to create more complex pics
* reveal
  - fns & recursion to assist
* reveal
  - renewed my interest in programming

### Act 2:
# Logo in Clojure

---

# Learning Clojure

* How to begin? and proceed?
* Examples abstract
* Like the Unix CLI
* Can it get better?

???

# Show, then tell -- but now in Clojure

* Elango's story of learning Clojure
  - Didn't know which reference resource to use
  - Didn't feel comfortable setting up environment in CLI
  - Reading about seqs, data structures, and core fns felt abstract
  - Fns like learning Unix CLI tools - don't know the perfect tool unless you already know it
  - Have to keep bashing your head against a wall until you learn it all
* Meanwhile, Logo is also a Lisp

Let's start off with a really simple shape: a square
<button onclick='introc(0);'>forward</button>
<button onclick='introc(1);'>right</button>

    (forward 30)
    (right 90)
    (forward 30)
    (right 90)
    (forward 30)
    (right 90)
    (forward 30)
    (right 90)
Okay, that's repetitive, so let's simplify that
<button onclick='introc(2);'>clean</button>

    (clean)
<button onclick='introc(3);'>square</button>

    (repeat 4 #(do (forward 30) (right 90)))
Let's create an octagon (a stop-sign shape).
It takes 2 turns to make a full 90 degrees, so
each turn will be 45 degrees
<button onclick='introc(4);'>clean</button>

    (clean)
<button onclick='introc(5);'>octagon</button>

    (repeat 8 #(do (forward 30) (right 45)))
Let's give a name to the code that draws an octagon
<button onclick='introc(6);'>defn octagon</button>

    (defn octagon [] (repeat 8 #(do (forward 30) (right 45))))
So we can just say `octagon` now
<button onclick='introc(7);'>clean</button>

    (clean)
<button onclick='introc(8);'>call octagon</button>

    (octagon)
Using `repeat` and doing some turning, we can rotate our octagon around
<button onclick='introc(9);'>spiragraph</button>

    (repeat 12 #(do (octagon) (right 30)))
Let's change the color and do that again
<button onclick='introc(10);'>blue</button>

    (color [0 0 255])
<button onclick='introc(11);'>spiragraph</button>

    (repeat 12 #(do (octagon) (right 30)))
Okay, let's see what we can do when we introduce
a little bit more Clojure gradually.
Let's go back to a simple octagon
<button onclick='introc(12);'>clean</button>
<button onclick='introc(13);'>black</button>
<button onclick='introc(14);'>octagon</button>

    (clean)
    (color [0])
    (octagon)
If we know the length of an octagon, we can start drawing
things around the octagon
<button onclick='introc(15);'>def size</button>
<button onclick='introc(16);'>penup</button>
<button onclick='introc(17);'>forward size</button>
<button onclick='introc(18);'>pendown</button>
<button onclick='introc(19);'>octagon</button>
<button onclick='introc(20);'>penup</button>
<button onclick='introc(21);'>forward size</button>
<button onclick='introc(22);'>pendown</button>
<button onclick='introc(23);'>octagon</button>

    (def size (+ 30 (/ 60 (js/Math.sqrt 2))))
    (penup)
    (forward size)
    (pendown)
    (octagon)
    (penup)
    (forward size)
    (pendown)
    (octagon)
Let's use `range` and `map` to create a column of octagons
<button onclick='introc(24);'>def octagon-at-height</button>

    (defn octagon-at-height
      [y]
      (home)
      (penup)
      (forward y)
      (pendown)
      (octagon))
  - <button onclick='introc(25);'>def offsets</button>


    (do
      (def offsets (range -2 3))
      (def y-coords (map (fn [o] (* size o)) offsets)))
  - <button onclick='introc(26);'>map octagon-at-height</button>


    (map octagon-at-height y-coords)
Let's cover the whole canvas.
Instead of worrying about `penup` and `pendown`,
let's use `setxy` to teleport the turtle.
First, let's use `for` to create the
xy-coordinates for all of the octagons
<button onclick='introc(27);'>def coords</button>


    (do

      (def offsets-xy (for [x (range -3 3) y (range -3 4)] [x y]))

      (defn offset-to-coord
        [offxy]
        [(* size (first offxy)) (* size (second offxy))])

      (def coords (map offset-to-coord offsets-xy)))
Next, we'll generalize our octagon fn to accept xy-coordinates.
And we'll throw in some randomness to make the color interesting.
<button onclick='introc(28);'>with-coords</button>


    (do

      (defn octagon-here
        [x y]
        (setxy x y)
        (color [0 (rand-int 255) (rand-int 255)])
        (octagon))

      (defn octagon-at-coord
        [coord]
        (octagon-here (first coord) (second coord))))
  - <button onclick='introc(29);'>cover plane</button>


    (map octagon-at-coord coords)

# Why is Logo interesting?

* Easy to learn
* Exploration
* Empowerment

???

* Logo is an environment that is:
  - simple
  - interactive
  - visual
* Exploration-based learning often used in Logo classes as mode of instruction
  - User learning how to interact & manipulate the environment
  - Gives sense of:
    * self-discovery, excitement, wonder
    * empowerment

background-image: url(../../../img/logo-turtle-robot.png)
background-position: center
background-repeat: no-repeat
background-size: contain

???

* Logo more than just drawing on a 2-D screen
  - Turtle envisioned also to be manifest as a real robot
* Interactivity means:
  - more than just one sense (vision <- also sound, touch)
  - more than just output (also input)
* A physical object makes it "real"
  - tangible
  - relatable
  - connected to reality, not abstract

# Philosophical design

* Logo's benefits not a happy coincidence, but by design
* Logo created by Seymour Papert
  - researcher in education and computer science
* main goals: interactivity & exploration - first & foremost
  - Seymour Papert
    * Knowledge = systems we create, to absorb new info
      - Those systems must be based on existing knowledge systems we created
    * Knowledge acquisition happens best when:
      - We can relate new info to existing knowledge in a personal way
      - We are put in control of our own learning
    * Created Logo just as a means to exemplify his theory

* But we have a different focus:
   - Blurring the lines between Logo and Clojure
   - Blurring the lines between Turtle and Programming

### Act 3:
# Clojure and Reach

???

@ Timothy

* I have a bold claim.
* I believe that Clojure is uniquely positioned to be the best first programming language
for nearly everybody.
  - I have some things to show you which I hope will convince too.
  - I did not believe this last year

---

<img alt="Happy friends" src="../img/friends2.jpg" style="width:100%">

???

* last year my friend Nathan
  - "I'm ready to give Clojure a try, I've even installed Emacs!"

---

<img alt="Friend showing other friend computer" src="../img/interested.jpg" style="width:100%">

???

* I said:
  - "Awesome! Clojure is so cool. First we need to setup..."

---

<img alt="Confused by computer" src="../img/beforeanger.jpg" style="width:100%">

???

* Install Java
* Get Leiningen
* Run this command to create a project
* Add these dependencies
* Start a REPL with control k meta j

---

<img alt="Bashing computer on table" src="../img/anger.gif" style="width:100%">

???

And he said:
   - "What is all this? I want to learn Clojure, not this stuff."

---

# Getting started

???

* Nathan is one of the best coders I know,
  - but there's still a barrier here.
  - we have all experienced this.
* It's easy to forget or dismiss this barrier
  - these things seem mundane to us now...
  - but learning new tools is often frustrating

---

# Getting started

<img src="../../../img/repl.png" width="400px" align="middle">

???

* The good news is that you can skip all that now
  - thanks to self hosted ClojureScript.
* All you need to code Clojure is a web browser.

<div id="app"></div>
</iframe>

???

* This is our website: Power Turtle; a batteries included REPL
* The first lesson
* I'll quickly show you the capabilities of Power Turtle
* small snippets that anyone can write, with some help from a lesson
* Freestyle mode
  - Turtle: <button onclick='freestyle_a()'>Turtle</button>
    - <button onclick='freestyle_aa()'>Add action</button>
  - Raster: <button onclick='freestyle_b()'>Raster</button>
    - <button onclick='freestyle_c()'>American flag</button>
    - <button onclick='freestyle_d()'>Conway's game of life</button>
  - Quil: <button onclick='freestyle_e()'>Elipses and animations</button>
  - Chart: <button onclick='freestyle_f()'>range</button>
  - <button onclick='freestyle_g()'>function</button>
  - <button onclick='freestyle_h()'>bar chart</button>
  - HTML: <button onclick='freestyle_i()'>headings,forms,lists</button>
  - <button onclick='freestyle_j()'>buttons, svg, games</button>
  - <button onclick='freestyle_k()'>embed other canvases</button>
* You can do all this without any setup
  - knowing nothing about the JVM, dependencies, or editors
    - or namespaces or referring symbols
  - I want programmers like Nathan to experience Clojure first
    - before they invest their time in the other stuff
    - and the same goes for beginner students too.
* There are lessons with a progression of concepts...
  - call a function
  - combine functions into new functions
  - repeat functions
  - create sequences
  - use sequences
  - modify sequences
  - always building cool stuff in the canvases
  - and on to more advanced topics
* There is a path for learners to start with Logo and transcend
  - into other interesting things
  - in Clojure

# Show, then tell

@ Elango

# Show, then tell

* Functions/HOF were the hard part for beginner students
  - Problems occur when explaining before internalization

* From our experience:
  - Show first, encourage practice, then explain
  - just show them fn & repeat
    - They get it.
  - In Blockly, repeat (HOF) is made by nested blocks inside a block

# Explaining too early can hurt

@ Elango


* Progression becomes impt
  - **Macros**
    * _We sometimes introduce macros midway through our lessons_
    * _Don't need to create them to use them_
  - **The 'list' fn**
    * _Probably don't need it except when writing macros_
  - **The 'vector' fn**
    * _Probably don't need it except when transposing nested data_
  - **cons cell**
    * _Probably don't need it until writing a custom lazy seq_
* Papert:
  - visual and interactive is necessary but not sufficient
  - new info must relate to existing knowledge
* Clojure and Logo
  - **Logo - simple & small set of primitives**
    * _Allows people internalize easily_
  - Likewise, we can teach Clojure by starting with a small core of primitives
  - **Clojure vs. Logo**
    * _Easy to learn everything there is to Logo because its core is small_
    * _Clojure has much larger core, so ordering matters much more_

    Hi!

    In this lesson you will be sending commands to a robot turtle,

    ---

    Type this command into the text area:

        (forward 50)

## Direct link your own lesson

@ Timothy

* Perhaps you have a lesson in mind that you want to teach?
  - Good news! Lessons are markdown text files
  - Markdown is easy to edit
* We want our lessons to cater to most beginners,
* But beginners come from different backgrounds
  - school, university, other fields
  - maybe they only speak French and need a translation
  - so it is very important to us that you can create a lesson tailored to your situation
* Your lesson can be loaded remotely by supplying a url suffix
  - this link loads your lesson in Power Turtle
  - we would love it if you would send us the markdown
    * we will include it in the lesson list
    * so that everyone can benefit

@ Timothy

Here is some feedback I received about the existing lessons:

> “It was quite astounding how Noah went off on his own tangent to draw his own patterns about half way through the lesson!”

* This is exactly what I had hoped for.
* Lessons are guides, but you can really do whatever you want.
* The emphasis is on self discovery.
* Lessons are interesting when they challenge us; can you draw this shape?
  - and provide a new concept to achieve it

* Getting started in Power Turtle is easy
  - but there is an even bigger barrier to learning Clojure for the majority of people;
  - they have to learn a foreign language first.

* My friend Alex is from Korea.
* I asked him: "How did you learn programming?"
  - he said: "First I learnt English. Then I went to an Australian University. Now I work at Microsoft."
* He made it sound easy, but that is a decade of dedication right there.
* Only 5% of the world speaks English as a first language.
* 20% if you include bilingual speakers.
* For most people who want to learn programming, their getting started experience is
  - "Awesome! Programming is really useful. Go learn English first."
* I knew that Elango had translated Clojure to Thamil
  - and I wondered if we could do that in Power Turtle

# Parlez vous Clojure?

* I'm pretty sure Clojure is a French word right?
* I think it strange but Elango and I hear a common response to programming in another language;
  "They're going to have to learn English anyway."
* That’s missing the point: Translations are great!
  - I'm sure you know geometry... it’s Greek! Someone translated it.
  - Astronomy? Latin
  - Einstein? wrote his work in German
  - Marie Curie? French
  - Translations are just plain useful
  - They are also super easy in Clojure, so why not?

# Thamil

    [clj-thamil "0.2.0"]

???

This is Elango's library for writing Clojure in other spoken languages

  * It works great in Clojure
  * It relies on macro-writing macros, which does not work in ClojureScript
  * So we made something that works in both

Dear Tim

    ERROR - Cannot read property 'call' of undefined

Not sure what I am doing, Love Mum

* When you typo a function call, this is the message you get
* There's still some friction here that we need to smooth out

# ClojureScript REPLs

## Klipse

Blogs, website, documentation

![Klipse](img/klipse.gif)

## Replumb

More effort, more control

???

* Perhaps you are interested in building something like Power Turtle yourself
* Here's how you can go about it:
  - If you want to embed a ClojureScript REPL on your blog or website,
  - use Klipse
    * it's super easy!
    * just include a script in your page and any code blocks become editable
    * users really appreciate it; I get much more traffic when I use it

* Replumb is what Power Turtle uses as a REPL
  - Takes more effort, provides more control

# Learning Clojure through Logo

???

Which brings us back to Learning Clojure through Logo...

* The Logo - Clojure connection is a steady progression from beginner to advanced
* Self hosted ClojureScript makes it easy to get started
* Translations make it accessible to the wider world
* It's fun and you're in control
* That is why I believe Clojure is the best first language, for everyone.
